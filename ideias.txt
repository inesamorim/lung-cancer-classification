- o numero de slides depende da resolução (diantância entre slides)
- quanto maior o número de slides, maior será a precisão
- 2D vs 3D: análise slice a slice (de forma independente) vs análise de todos os slices ao mesmo tempo
  - usar apenas a imagem central do nodule na CNN
  - usar varias imagens na CNN e "juntar" para as linear layers
- analisar os prós e contras de cada ideia


# features das imagens/nodules:

//intensity-based, shape-based, texture-based, and edge-related features.

->intensity-based(measure pixel intensity/brightness and contrast):
  The average pixel value in the nodule region
  intensity varies across the nodule(s)
  Minimum and Maximum Intensity
  asymmetry of the intensity distribution (a sign of uneven tissue density)
  Kurtosis: A measure of the "peakedness" or flatness of the intensity distribution
  Histogram of Intensities: Distribution of pixel intensity values

->shape-based:
  area 
  perimeter 
  how much the shape deviates from being circular; malignant nodules often appear irregular or elongated
  Aspect Ratio: The ratio of the major to minor axis lengths of the bounding ellipse (helps identify elongated nodules)
  how compact or spread out the nodule appears. Malignant nodules tend to have lower compactness due to irregular shapes.
  Solidity: The ratio of the nodule area to the convex hull area. Lower values can indicate concavities in the shape?

->texture-based:
  Quantifies how spiculated (having spikes or points) the edge of the nodule is. Malignant nodules tend to have spiculated or jagged edges

->edge-related:

->contextual:
  The location of the nodule in the lung (upper, lower, central) can provide context about malignancy risk
  The contrast between the nodule and its surrounding tissue may indicate malignancy.
  Malignant nodules may appear near or interact with blood vessels, leading to distinct features around the edges of the nodule

->frequency-domain:
  features capture shape information in the frequency domain
